This project hosts operations research tools developed at Google and
made available as open source under the Apache 2.0 License.

OR-Tools includes solvers for:

- Constraint Programming
  - CP-SAT solver: A constraint programming solver that uses SAT (satisfiability)
  methods.
  - Original CP solver: A constraint programming solver.
- Linear and Mixed-Integer Programming
  - Glop: A linear optimizer to find the optimal value of a linear objective
  function, given a set of linear inequalities as constraints.
  - MPSolver, ModelBuilder: Wrappers around commercial and other open source
  solvers, including mixed integer solvers: CBC, CLP, GLPK, Gurobi or SCIP.
- Vehicle Routing
  A specialized library for identifying best vehicle routes given constraints.
- Graph Algorithms
  Code for finding shortest paths in graphs, min-cost flows, max flows, and
  linear sum assignments.
